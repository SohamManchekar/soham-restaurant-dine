ğŸ”´ Note : you need client and backend runs concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk to each other.

    // For deployment(once react app is ready to deploy)
    $ npm run build       // This will compile the React App and make a ./build folder in root directory.
  
  
# Server-side usage PORT(8080) - backend
